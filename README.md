# Health Monitoring System: Physical and Mental Health Assessment
## Overview
This project is a comprehensive health monitoring system that utilizes advanced machine learning models to assess both physical and mental health. The system allows users to input health-related data. The system is designed with a user-friendly interface and is accessible from any device with an internet connection.

## Features
Dual Health Assessment: The system evaluates both physical and mental health metrics, offering a holistic view of the userâ€™s overall health.
Machine Learning Models: Multiple models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, and Random Forest, are used to ensure high accuracy in predictions.
User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-navigate UI that allows users to input data, receive results, and access actionable insights.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following key components:

/data: Contains the datasets used for training and testing the machine learning models.
/Jupyter files: Includes the scripts for training the machine learning models and the saved model files.
/models: Having ht pickled models files
/ui: Contains the code for the user interface, including frontend only.
/docs: Documentation related to the project, including the requirement file.

## Installation
To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. *Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/health-monitoring-system.git
cd health-monitoring-system
Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Install the required Python packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the Datasets:
Place the datasets for physical and mental health assessment in the /data directory.

Train the Models:
Train the machine learning models by running the training scripts in the /models directory:

bash
Copy code
python models/train_physical_health_model.py
python models/train_mental_health_model.py
Run the UI:
Launch the user interface by running the following command in the /ui directory:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Access the Application:
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to access the health monitoring system.

Usage
Once the system is running, users can:

Input Data: Enter health-related information through the user interface.
Receive Assessment: The system will analyze the data and provide real-time feedback on physical and mental health.
View Recommendations: Users will receive actionable insights and recommendations based on their health status.
Models Used
Support Vector Machine (SVM): Effective for high-dimensional data and binary classification.
Decision Tree: Provides a visual representation of decisions and their possible consequences.
Logistic Regression: Used for binary classification, particularly for mental health assessment.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Simple, instance-based learning algorithm for classification.
Naive Bayes: Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, useful for mental health predictions.
Random Forest: Ensemble learning method that improves accuracy and robustness.
Deployment
The system is deployed on a cloud platform for scalability and accessibility. The deployment process includes:

API Integration: Facilitates communication between the frontend UI and the backend model execution engine.
Cloud Services: The system is hosted on a cloud service provider, ensuring reliable and scalable access.
Security: Data is encrypted and secure user authentication is implemented to protect sensitive information.
